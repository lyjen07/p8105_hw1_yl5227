# Problem 1


I'm loading the **moderndive** library

```{r}
library(moderndive)
```

I'm loading the _early_january_weather_ dataset

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```


## Section 1: Short description of the dataset

This dataset records weather information, such as _temperature_, _humidity_, _wind speed_ and other weather parameters with a specific date and time, down to the _year_, _month_, _day_, and _hour_.

It contains `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns. 

We can tell from the dataset that the mean temperature of the early January in 2013 was about `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp), 1)` degrees, with a maximum temperature of `r round(max(early_january_weather$temp), 1)` degrees and a minimum temperature of `r round(min(early_january_weather$temp), 1)` degrees.
