# Problem 1

## Section 1

I'm loading the **moderndive** library

```{r}
library(moderndive)
```

I'm loading the _early_january_weather_ dataset

```{r}
data("early_january_weather")
```


## Section 2

This dataset records early January weather information in 2013.


The mean temperature of the early January in 2013 was about `r round(mean(early_january_weather$temp), 1)` degrees, with a maximum temperature of `r round(max(early_january_weather$temp), 1)` degrees and a minimum temperature of `r round(min(early_january_weather$temp), 1)` degrees.
