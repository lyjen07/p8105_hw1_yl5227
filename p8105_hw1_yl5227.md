# Problem 1

I’m loading the **moderndive** library

``` r
library(moderndive)
```

I’m loading the *early_january_weather* dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

## Section 1: Short description of the dataset

This dataset records weather information, such as *temperature*,
*humidity*, *wind speed* and other weather parameters with a specific
date and time, down to the *year*, *month*, *day*, and *hour*.

It contains 358 rows and 15 columns.

We can tell from the dataset that the mean temperature of the early
January in 2013 was about 39.6 degrees, with a maximum temperature of
57.9 degrees and a minimum temperature of 24.1 degrees.

## Section 2: Temp vs Time_hour plot

I’m installing package required for ggplot

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

I’m making a scatterplot of *temp* (y) vs *time_hour* (x); color points
using the *humid* variable, and label the axes.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
      geom_point() +
      labs(x = "Time (Hour)", y = "Temperature (degrees)", color = "Humidity")
```

**The plot shows an increasing trend for temperature and humidity as
time passes within this period of time.**

Export scatterplot to project directory

``` r
ggsave("Temp vs Time_hour plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```
