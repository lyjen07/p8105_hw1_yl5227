# Problem 1

I’m loading the **moderndive** library

``` r
library(moderndive)
```

I’m loading the *early_january_weather* dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

## Section 1: Short description of the dataset

This dataset records weather information, such as *temperature*,
*humidity*, *wind speed* and other weather parameters with a specific
date and time, down to the *year*, *month*, *day*, and *hour*.

It contains 358 rows and 15 columns.

We can tell from the dataset that the mean temperature of the early
January in 2013 was about 39.6 degrees, with a maximum temperature of
57.9 degrees and a minimum temperature of 24.1 degrees.
