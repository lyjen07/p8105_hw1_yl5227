# Problem 1

I’m loading the **moderndive** library

``` r
library(moderndive)
```

I’m loading the *early_january_weather* dataset

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

## Short description of the dataset

This dataset records weather information, such as *temperature*,
*humidity*, *wind speed* and other weather parameters with a specific
date and time, down to the *year*, *month*, *day*, and *hour*. It is
worth to notice that there are missing values for variables *wind_gust*
and *pressure*.

It contains 358 rows and 15 columns.

We can tell from the dataset that the mean temperature of the early
January in 2013 was about 39.6 degrees, with a maximum temperature of
57.9 degrees and a minimum temperature of 24.1 degrees.

## Temp vs Time_hour plot

I’m installing package required for ggplot

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

I’m making a scatterplot of *temp* (y) vs *time_hour* (x); color points
using the *humid* variable, and label the axes.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + 
      geom_point() +
      labs(x = "Time (Hour)", y = "Temperature (degrees)", color = "Humidity")
```

**The plot shows an increasing trend for temperature and humidity as
time passes within this period of time.**

Export scatterplot to project directory

``` r
ggsave("Temp vs Time_hour plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6)
```

# Problem 2

Create a data frame comprised of:

- a random sample of size 10 from a standard Normal distribution

- a logical vector indicating whether elements of the sample are greater
  than 0

- a character vector of length 10

- a factor vector of length 10, with 3 different factor “levels”

``` r
df = tibble(
    rsam = rnorm(10),
    logical = rsam > 0,
    char = c("A", "B", "C", "D","E", "F", "G", "H","I", "J"),
    fac = factor(c("low", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high", "low", "medium", "high", "low"))
  )
```

Take the mean of each variable in dataframe **df**.

``` r
mean(pull(df, rsam))
```

    ## [1] -0.1777547

``` r
mean(pull(df, logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.4

``` r
mean(pull(df, char))
```

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df, fac))
```

    ## [1] NA

**The mean function works for the random sample and logical vector, but
does not work for character vector and factor vector.**

Apply the *as.numeric* function to the logical, character, and factor
variables

``` r
as.numeric(pull(df, logical))
as.numeric(pull(df, char))
as.numeric(pull(df, fac))
```

**The *as.numeric* function works for logical vector and the factor
vector, but it doesn’t work for character vector. The *as.numeric*
function transforms the values of logical vector and factor vector into
numbers - True to 1 and False to 0, and three levels of factor to 1, 2,
and 3.However, converting alphabet characters into numeric values using
*as.numeric* function will return *NA*.**
